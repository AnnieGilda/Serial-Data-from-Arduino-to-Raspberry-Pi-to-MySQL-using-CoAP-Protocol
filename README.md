In this tutorial We are going to tell you how we can get the sensor data from Arduino Uno and sending it to the Raspberry PI through UART. Mostly We are going to do twoa important things. First we will use a CoAP server For making a GET request which will run on raspberry pi and in our CoAP browser we will get the DHT22 data immediately. And the second thing is we are going to make a mysql database in raspberry pi to store the value of DHT22 sensor.
